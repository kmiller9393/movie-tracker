### Project

MurrayTracker is an application that utilizes The Movie Database API and displays all of Bill Murray's top movies. This web application was built using React, Redux, Router along with a PostgreSQL backend database. We used Waffle.io to outline the project and manage our team's workflow. Jest and Enzyme was used for testing.

#### Getting Started

1. clone down this repository.

2. cd into the back-end directory and run npm start.

3. cd into the movie-tracker directory within the root directory.

4. npm install.

5. npm start.

#### User Interface

Upon page load, the user has access to the entire library of Murray films. By clicking a card, the user sees an overview of the film, date it was released, and rating. If the user chooses to 'favorite' the film and they are not logged in, they will be prompted to sign in. Once signed in, a user has the ability to favorite a movie, adding the favorite to the favorites page. After selecting 'favorites', the user sees all of their favorited movie. By clicking 'unfavorite', they remove the favorited movie from their favorites page.
